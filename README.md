☁️ Cloud Security Labs — AWS
Hands-on AWS cloud security labs focused on visibility, detection, and incident response from a SOC perspective.
This repository demonstrates how security teams monitor, detect and respond to threats in AWS environments using logs, telemetry and security best practices.


🎯 Objective
To showcase practical cloud security operations aligned with SOC workflows, including:
Visibility and logging
Detection use cases
Incident investigation
Security posture hardening
This is cloud security for defenders, not architecture theory.


🧠 Cloud Security Perspective
In cloud environments, security depends on:
Telemetry first (logs and signals)
Contextual detections
Fast investigation
Clear ownership between cloud and SOC
These labs reflect that reality.
🔍 What You’ll Find Here
✔ AWS security monitoring scenarios
✔ CloudTrail analysis
✔ IAM security use cases
✔ Network visibility and anomalies
✔ Detection ideas mapped to SOC operations
✔ Incident response considerations in cloud
🛡️ Key AWS Security Components Covered


AWS CloudTrail
IAM & Access Analysis
VPC Flow Logs
S3 Security & Logging
Security monitoring concepts
Cloud-native detection ideas


🧪 Example Scenarios
Suspicious IAM activity
Abnormal API calls
Unauthorized access attempts
Misconfiguration leading to exposure
Cloud incident investigation workflow
Each scenario answers:
“How would a SOC detect and investigate this in AWS?”

🛠️ Tools & Concepts Applied
AWS logging & telemetry
Cloud security monitoring
IAM security analysis
Detection logic (tool-agnostic)
SOC investigation workflows
Cloud incident response concepts


🧠 Why This Matters
Many SOC analysts struggle in cloud environments because:
logs are misunderstood
detections lack context
ownership is unclear
This repository demonstrates how SOC thinking translates to the cloud.


🎯 Target Audience
SOC Analysts
Cloud Security Analysts
Detection Engineers
Blue Team Engineers
Security Operations Teams
